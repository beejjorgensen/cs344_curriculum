## Introduction

This week we're going to discuss scheduling: how the OS decides which
process, out of all the ones that want CPU, gets to run next.

## Goals

* Understand _scheduling disciplines_ and the rationale behind them.
* Know the difference between _preemptive_ and _non-preemptive_
  scheduling.
* See how I/O influences scheduling.
* Study and understand the _multi-level feedback queue_, an effective
  scheduler.
  
## Module Learning Outcomes
  
After the successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

* Describe how different scheduling disciplines work, and their
  advantages and drawbacks.
* Describe how context switches work with the scheduler.
* Write a simple shell of your own from scratch in C that uses syscalls
  to launch programs.
