## HOW TO

All the Markdown stuff here is for Canvas.

Start all top-level headers for Canvas with `##` (header 2).

VS Code preview sadly doesn't copy out the `<pre>` attribute for code
blocks in a way that Canvas understands.

Install `cmark-gfm` and `make` to build the `.html` files. You can paste
the HTML files into the Canvas HTML editor.

`make clean` to get rid of the `.html` files.

## Process

1. Paste all the pages into Canvas.
2. For each Exploration:
   * Add rubric with text below, question is worth 1 point.
   * Make it worth 1 point.
   * Online submission, text entry.
   * Set the due date to 11:59 PM the day after the corresponding class.
3. For each quiz
   * The quiz must be pasted in a question at a time.
   * Set the due date for 11:59 PM the Sunday after the quiz.
4. For each project
   * Add the rubric, and make sure the points match the quiz
   * Online submission: website URL
   * Set the due date for 11:59 PM the Sunday after the quiz,
2. Edit links in Overview.
3. Copy link destination URLs in Overview back into the Markdown files.

### Pasting into Canvas

1. Edit the page.
2. Switch to the HTML editor.
3. Paste the HTML page in.

## Gotchas

* After pasting, look at the Canvas accessibility checker to see if
  there's anything that needs fixing (i.e. table captions).

* The quizzes have to be pasted in a line at once. Bummer.
