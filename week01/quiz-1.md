What are the basic differences between User Mode and Kernel Mode?

Your program runs in kernel mode when interfacing with hardware or accessing something permissions-restricted, otherwise it's in user mode.

Your program runs in user mode when interfacing with hardware or accessing something permissions-restricted.

The OS runs in user mode when accessing the keyboard or displaying output, and kernel mode when accessing files.

When people are writing OS kernel software, they do it in kernel mode.  User mode is for things like games.

Only computer controlled popcorn poppers and dad joke AIs run in kernel mode.

What is virtualization when it comes to operating systems?

Presenting hardware to processes so they all think they have the hardware to themselves.

Running several OSes at once, sometimes called virtual machines.

Hooking up a VR headset to your computer is a form of virtualization.

Mapping hardware to a file system interface.

Presenting a software interface for hardware, e.g. an on-screen keyboard.

What are the responsibilities of the operating system? What are its main functions?

Virtualizing hardware, providing an API for accessing it, managing processes, handling access permissions.

What is a trap? How does it relate to system calls?

A trap occurs when a system call is initiated and the program enters kernel mode.

A trap occurs when a system call is initiated and the program enters user mode.

A trap occurs when a system call completes and the program returns to user mode.

A trap occurs when a system call completes and the program returns to kernel mode.

Describe Unix pipes.

Pipes allow output from one program to be sent to the input of another.

Pipes allow input from one program to be sent to the output of another.

Pipes allow input from one program to be sent to the input of another.

Pipes are a mechanism for improving kernel performance.

Pipes move data between kernel mode and user mode, since user mode doesn't have permissions.

Describe regular expressions. What is their purpose? What tools use them?

Regular expressions describe a pattern to be matched, and are used in vim, sed, grep, and other programs.

Regular expressions describe a mathematical formula to be solved, and are used in vim, sed, grep, and other programs.

Regular expressions are used to define kernel functionality, and are used by all programs.

Regular expressions are used to define APIs, as used by web frameworks.

Regular expressions are very simple and no one ever had hard time learning them. As used by Minecraft.

What is a shell script?

A program or series of commands written in the shell's language, good for automating tasks.

A program or series of commands written in the shell's language, good for writing graphical user interfaces.

A program written in C that the shell executes, good for speeding up tasks.

A program written in C that implements a shell, good for running shell scripts.
