<!-- Overview: Introduction, Shell Scripting -->

## Introduction

Welcome to operating systems, where we learn all about what's going on
between you and the hardware. What happens when you run a command from
the shell prompt? How are processes created and destroyed? How is memory
managed? And more!

Though many of us in our programming careers only use the functionality
of the OS indirectly though libraries, knowing how the operating system
works internally will make you a more complete developer, more
comfortable in the medium in which you strive to work the art.

## Goals

* Demystify what an OS is and what it's responsible for
* Learn how to interface with the OS to get it to do your bidding
* Write a bunch of code that not only talks to the OS but also drives
  deeper understanding of OS internals
* Get more comfortable in the medium overall
* Have fun!

## Framing

In a nutshell, the OS is software that provides:

* An API for accessing hardware and resources (e.g. files, networks)
* Access controls over hardware and resources (e.g. files, networks) per user
* A mechanism for tracking multiple processes and their memory use

It's more complex than that, but keep those overarching functions in
mind as we fill in the gaps.

## Module Learning Outcomes

After the successful completion of this module, you will be able to:

* Describe how hardware is virtualized by the operating system.
* Write shell scripts to automate tasks.
* Use regular expressions for pattern matching.
* Use pipes to connect processes.
